Hi! You are looking for a web developer who can create a food ordering website with a QR ordering code feature.
I strongly feel that I can easily complete this task for you as I have built a dynamic blog as a personal project previously. The link to the project is http://ovolisky.000webhostapp.com if you wish to take a look at it.
I will use the popular MySQL database to store all data including the account information of your customers and query the database using the popular PHP programming language. I can also integrate AJAX into your website to make assynchronous requests to the server if you wish to give your site a more dynamic and professional look.
I will also build the admin control panel which would be unaccessible by any user not registered as an admin and a special administrative position for you as the owner of the website to give you access to the activities of your admins as well as the ability to replace or block any of them.
Although I am not skilled in Java which is first on your criteria, I have all the skills required to complete this job. Will you please give me a chance to work on your project and showcase my talent to you? 
Thanks in advance!
